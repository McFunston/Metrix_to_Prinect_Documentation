# Metrix to Cockpit

This project documents and normalizes Metrix JDF output for Heidelberg Prinect Cockpit import.

## Private sample data

Sample files are not included in this repository. They contain proprietary job names and customer data.

## Data policy

This repository intentionally excludes any customer data, proprietary job identifiers, and production assets. All sample references are anonymized; private samples and mappings must remain outside the repo.

Expected local layout (outside this repo):

```
~/Metrix_to_Cockpit_PrivateSamples/
  Metrix_Samples/
  Signa_Samples/
  GeneratedJDFs/
```

Use absolute/relative paths to those folders when running tools. See `docs/samples/README.md` for more detail.
